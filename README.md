# Hows-the-weather-up-there

An application to check both current weather conditions and a 5 day forecast by city. Additional functionality includes a search history bar to store previous cities that when clicked will repopulate that city's info. As well as more specific information like wind speed, and uv index. An option has also been provided to clear the search history. This was a fairly challenging project. The openweather API is very useful, but took a bit of getting used to, along with some reading of documentation. Incorporating that into the other functions to use the information provided, present it in a useful format, then display it on the page was quite the challenge.
